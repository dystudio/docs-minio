Minio Tile deploys On-Demand-Broker for creating Minio instances. Developers can use `cf create-service` to create a new Minio instance on dedicated Virtual Machines. As Minio instances do not share VMs, workload of one Minio instance will not affect the other instances.

Minio object server on PCF (Pivotal Cloud Foundry) can be configured in four ways, as described in the user documentation.  In fact, the same executable binary will run in every instance, but the characteristics will be determined by the configuration parameters.

In the simplest case, a single instance will rely on the underlying storage system for data protection, and Minio’s extended methods for insuring data durability will not be applied, to minimize consumption of CPU and other resources.  As always for all instances of Minio object service, data access and related operations will be governed by the Amazon S3 compatible API.  In fact, if you have an application which you have used to access data on S3, it should work with Minio without any modification.

Another Minio configuration available on PCF launches multiple instances in which Reed-Solomon erasure coding is employed to protect each object from data loss.  Also, “bit-rot detection” based on hashed checksums is used to further insure data durability.

In both of the above configurations, the objects are stored locally on platforms hosted by PCF.  There are two additional configuration options also offered in which Minio’s object server acts as a translational gateway between applications running on PCF which use the S3 API and remote object storage written into the Azure Blob Storage or Google Cloud Storage services.  Those remote alternatives to Amazon S3 do not natively support the S3 API.  However, instead of rewriting applications to work with the native API specific to Azure or Google, Minio enables S3-based applications to utilize those services without modification — and without any performance or other functional tradeoffs.

Being able to use the same application with multiple diverse object storage platforms is an intrinsic element in any enterprise multi-cloud strategy, and that is an important goal for PCF.  Minio is committed to continuing to provide this and other enterprise multi-cloud capabilties to enterprise customers.
